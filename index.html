            <h2>What are the threats to nature?</h2>

            <p>There’s no mystery about why nature is under threat. The         assault on the natural world comes from all directions but especially from harmful human activity.</p>

            <p>Healthy environments support healthy wildlife. Twenty-first century threats to our environment - including invasive species, diseases, pollution, and a warming climate are putting wildlife population at risk.</p>

                
            <p> Not everyone has been responsible. Many cultures have always lived in step with nature. Many have understood that their lives today and tomorrow are entwined with having vibrant, abundant nature.</p>
                
            <p>But in the main, humans have found clever ways to lay waste to the Earth and to push countless species to the edge of existence.</p>
                
            <p> <b>SGERI</b>  is addressing these environmental threats and protecting our wildlife and their habitats. By doing so, we're not just helping our wildlife to flourish—we're helping people live healthier lives too.</p>

            <p> <strong> Here are some direct drivers of biodiversity loss: </strong></p>

            <ul>
               <li> <b> Habitat loss,</b> which is the lead threat to biodiversity and contributes to the endangerment of over 80 percent of all species.</li>
               <li><b>Pollution,</b> including the use of chemicals, fossil fuels and plastics, which disrupts the earth’s ecosystems, injuring species and changing their habits.</li>

               <li> <b>Rapidly increasing climate change,</b>  which is changing growing patterns, food availability and migration patterns faster than ecosystems and species can adjust.</li>
               <li><b> Overexploitation,</b> which is the over-harvesting of species faster than they can naturally reproduce.</li>
               <li><b> Invasive species,</b> which are often introduced by human action and can threaten native species and their ecosystems.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The importance of nature for humans</h2>

            
            <p><em> Nature is essential to our lives – from the food on our plates to the clothes we wear, from medicines to mental health benefits.</em></p>

            <p>Seven out of 10 people admit they’re losing touch with nature. And more than a third of parents admit they could not teach their own children about British wildlife.</p>

            <p>It’s easy to think nature will always be with us. But even in our lifetime, birds like starlings and house sparrows have declined so much they’re now listed as endangered.</p>
                
            <p>In fact, nature is faring worse in the UK than in most other countries. The latest State of Nature report shows that over half our wild species – plants, insects, birds, mammals – are in decline.</p>
