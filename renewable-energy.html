                <h2>What is renewable energy?</h2>

                <p>Renewable energy, often referred to as clean energy, comes from natural sources or processes that are
                    constantly replenished. For example, sunlight or wind keep shining and blowing, even if their
                    availability depends on time and weather.</p>

                <p>While renewable energy is often thought of as a new technology, harnessing nature’s power has long
                    been used for heating, transportation, lighting, and more. Wind has powered boats to sail the seas
                    and windmills to grind grain. The sun has provided warmth during the day and helped kindle fires to
                    last into the evening. But over the past 500 years or so, humans increasingly turned to cheaper,
                    dirtier energy sources such as coal and fracked gas.</p>

                <p>Now that we have increasingly innovative and less-expensive ways to capture and retain wind and solar
                    energy, renewables are becoming a more important power source, accounting for more than one-eighth
                    of U.S. generation. The expansion in renewables is also happening at scales large and small, from
                    rooftop solar panels on homes that can sell power back to the grid to giant offshore wind farms.
                    Even some entire rural communities rely on renewable energy for heating and lighting.</p>

                <p>As renewable use continues to grow, a key goal will be to modernize Britain's electricity grid,
                    making it smarter, more secure, and better integrated across regions.</p>

                <h2>Why is renewable energy important?</h2>

                <p>Renewable energy is energy derived from natural resources that replenish themselves in less than a
                    human lifetime without depleting the planet’s resources. These resources – such as sunlight, wind,
                    rain, tides, waves, biomass and thermal energy stored in the earth’s crust – have the benefit of
                    being available in one form or another nearly everywhere. They are virtually inexhaustible. And,
                    what is even more important, they cause little climate or environmental damage.</p>

                <p>Fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas on the contrary are available in finite quantities
                    only. As we keep extracting them, they will run out sooner or later. Although they are produced in
                    natural processes, they do not replenish as quickly as we humans use them.</p>



                <p>Today, the world still heavily relies on fossil fuels and even continues subsidising them. Meanwhile,
                    the pollution they cause – from climate-damaging greenhouse gases to health-endangering particles –
                    has reached record levels. And when something goes wrong, for example when the Deepwater Horizon oil
                    platform exploded in 2010, the consequences are dramatic. </p>

                <p>Since 2011, renewable energy is growing faster than all other energy forms. Renewable energy had
                    another record-breaking year in 2020, as installed power capacity grew more than 256 gigawatts (GW)
                    – its largest increase ever. More than 29% of our electricity now comes from renewable energy – and
                    this keeps growing.</p>
