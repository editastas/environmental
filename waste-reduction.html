            <h2>Waste reduction</h2>

        
            <p>The government is committed to reducing the amount of waste and has set targets for waste reduction. A new strategy for cutting waste was published in 2019 looking for at least 40 per cent of household waste to be recycled or composted by 2020, rising to 50 per cent by 2022.</p>

            <p>Local authorities are responsible for waste disposal and the government has introduced legislative targets for local authorities. The Municipal Waste Management Statistics for 2008/9 show that the total amount of municipal waste is decreasing with an increase in the proportion of municipal waste being recycled or composted, increasing to 37.6 per cent in 2008/09, up by 3 per cent on 2007/08.</p>

            <p>Here in SHERI we estimated that at least half of the contents of our dustbins could potentially be recycled. In addition, we could compost the 20% of vegetable peelings and other organic waste that we throw away. Despite this potential to recycle or compost around 60% – 70% of our waste, we are only recycling or composting 12%. A total of 80% of municipal waste is landfilled and 8% is incinerated to produce energy.</p>


            <h2>What is compost and why we should do it?</h2>

            <p>If you don’t currently have a food and or garden waste collection service, then your waste will be getting sent to landfill.</p>

            <p> When organic material such as garden waste and food waste breaks down in landfill it produces a harmful greenhouse gas called methane, which contributes to the climate crisis.</p>
                
            <p>Some of this organic material can be composted at home, and what’s more, you’ll get free fertiliser for your garden and plant pots to keep them looking beautiful. </p>

            <h2>What can I compost?</h2>

            <p>There is a lot that  can go into your compost bin, from the usual vegetable peelings and autumn leaves to some items that might surprise you – eggshells, hair and even the contents of your vacuum cleaner can all be emptied into the bin.</p>

            <p>To make the best compost, aim for a 50/50 mix of both green and brown materials in your compost bin.</p>

            <p>Green materials contain lots of nitrogen. They break down quickly and help to keep the compost moist. Green materials include:</p>

            <ul>
               <li> Cut flowers</li>
               <li>Fruit scraps and vegetable peelings</li>
               <li>Grass cuttings</li>
               <li>Young annual weeds</li>
               <li>Tea leaves/bads and coffee grounds</li>


            </ul>

            <p>Brown materials contain lots of carbon. They break down more slowly and add structure to your compost. They also create air pockets which are important for air circulation. Brown materials include:</p> 

            <ul>
                <li>Paper items which can include scrunched up cardboard, egg boxes, toilet roll tubes, shredded letters, unwanted mail including envelopes with the windows taken out</li>
                <li>Straw and hay</li>
                <li>Egg shells</li>
                <li>The contents of your vacuum cleaner</li>
                <li>Hedge and woody trimmings like roses</li>
            </ul>
            <br>


            <h2>What can I compost?</h2>

            <p>Please do NOT put the following materials in your compost bin:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Cooked food</li>
                <li>Raw meat and fish</li>
                <li>Dairy Products</li>
                <li>Animal waste</li>
                <li>Diseased plants</li>
                <li>Nappies, glass, plastic or metal</li>
                <li>Bread or bakery</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It is important only the right materials go into your compost bin. Continue to use your normal household bin and recycling services available to you for all other waste. </p>


            <h2>It’s a waiting game!</h2>
            <p>It will usually take over twelve months for your compost to become ready for use, so now all you need to do is wait and let nature do all the hard work.</p>

            <p>Keep on adding greens and browns to top up your compost and stir the pile now and again to help aerate the compost, help it to ‘cook’ faster and stop it from becoming matted down. Don’t worry if you can’t stir the pile - it will just take a little longer but will get there eventually.</p>
